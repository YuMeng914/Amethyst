# Amethyst
Amethyst is a pipeline for analysis of Deep Mutational Scanning (DMS) sequencing data. This release features a GUI which allows users to easily install and operate, and generates a heatmap which visualizes the enrichment of each variant in the DMS library. Also by integrating NGmerge (Gaspar JM, 2018) into this pipeline, users can directly upload the paired-end sequencing data acquired from NGS.

## Installation
